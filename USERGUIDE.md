## Design

The following [Dublin Core Metadata Elements](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) describe the entries in the Zhongfa Directory:

### creator

The most senior unit that signed or commented on the document.

### identifier

The number identifying the document’s position in the zhongfa sequence. The Directory format is YYYY-NNNN. The “doc_no” for “Zhongfa (1976) no. 18” would be “1976-0018”.   

### dateAccepted

The date when the highest-ranking unit signed or commented on the document.

### SecurityClassification

Proposed qualifier for the "Rights" element. See [Security Classification qualifier for Rights element](http://www.dublincore.org/usage/meetings/2002/10/securityClassification/).

Follows the PRC’s three-graded system of classification:

* top secret (绝密 juemi)
* secret (机密 jimi)
* confidential (秘密 mimi).

Systematic data on classification grade is only available for entries with the source 国防大学(1989). In these and only these cases, lack of specification may be interpreted to mean that the documents were marked for internal circulation (内部 neibu). In some cases an attachment may have a higher degree of classification than the main document. The Zhongfa Directory does not reflect this distinction, the entry is listed according to the higher level of classification.

### title

The title of the document according to the source. Some of these titles are not those that appeared on the original document, but descriptive titles used in reference to the document at a later date.

### hasPart

Refers to an attachment (附件 fujian) to the main document. Here, attachments include only documents or document collections that are explicitly referred to as such in the sources. Many Central Documents transmit texts (speeches, reports, decisions, etc.); these are not included in the “attachment” field.           

### source

An abbreviated reference to the source from which document data has been collected. For full bibliographic information, see below.

## References

The main source used in the compilation of the Zhongfa Directory (v.1.0) is a 1989 index of Central Documents kept by the National Defence University Second Campus Library.

The single most important complementary source is an unpublished list of Central Documents from 1966 to 1976 compiled by Michael Schoenhals in the preparation of his *CCP Central Documents from the Cultural Revolution: Index to an Incomplete Data Base*, Working Paper 32 (Stockholm: Center for Pacific Asia Studies at Stockholm University, 1993).
